## 🛒 Project 1 — eCommerce Data Analysis

**File:** `eCommerce_Data_Analysis.py`

End-to-end exploratory data analysis on a customer orders dataset, extracting actionable business intelligence about revenue, customer behavior, and delivery performance.

### 🔍 Key Steps

| Step | Details |
|------|---------|
| Data Cleaning | Removed duplicate orders by `Order_ID`, handled nulls |
| Feature Engineering | Created `Total_Spend = Quantity × Price`, extracted `Year`, `Month`, `Day` from `Order_Date` |
| Business Questions | Total revenue, AOV, most popular categories, top city by revenue, late delivery % |
| Visualizations | Bar chart (product categories), pie chart (payment methods), histogram (age), heatmap (Age/Qty/Spend), boxplot (spending by gender) |

### 📊 Business Insights Extracted
- Total Revenue & Average Order Value (AOV)
- Most popular product categories by sales count
- Top revenue-generating city
- Customer age group spending distribution
- Late delivery percentage calculation

**Libraries:** `pandas` `numpy` `seaborn` `matplotlib` `scipy`

## 🏢 Project 2 — IT Company Workforce Analytics

**File:** `IT_COMPANY_DATA.PY`

Advanced data cleaning and feature engineering on a **corrupted** IT company dataset — the most technically complex project in the repo. Missing values in `Salary`, `Performance_Score`, `Experience_Years`, and `Projects` were imputed using **domain-based range logic** rather than simple mean/median.

### 🔍 Key Steps

| Step | Details |
|------|---------|
| Smart Imputation | Missing salary/score/experience/projects filled using conditional ranges based on correlated columns |
| Rank Feature Engineering | Created `Rank` column (`Low / Average / High`) using `np.select` with multi-condition logic |
| Top Performers | Extracted top 5 records by salary, experience, performance score, and project count |
| Visualizations | Salary distribution (`displot`), Salary vs Experience joint regression plot |
| Export | Cleaned dataset exported to Excel |

### 💡 Notable Technique
This project avoids naive mean imputation — instead, it infers missing values by cross-referencing multiple correlated columns (e.g., if salary is high → infer high experience), demonstrating real-world data cleaning thinking.

**Libraries:** `pandas` `numpy` `matplotlib` `seaborn`

## 🏥 Project 3 — Patient Data Analysis

**File:** `Patient_data_Analysis.py`

Healthcare analytics pipeline on patient appointment data to understand visit trends, revenue distribution, and doctor performance.

### 🔍 Key Steps

| Step | Details |
|------|---------|
| Data Cleaning | Removed duplicate patient records by `Patient_ID` |
| Datetime Engineering | Extracted `Year`, `Month`, `Day` from `Appointment_Date` |
| Business Questions | Total consultation revenue, busiest department, top doctor, most common age group, no-show % |
| Visualizations | Bar chart (patients per dept), pie chart (payment methods), heatmap (Age/Fees/Visit status), boxplot (fees by dept) |

### 📊 Business Insights Extracted
- Total consultation revenue
- Highest patient volume department
- Doctor handling the most patients
- No-show appointment percentage
- Highest revenue-generating city

**Libraries:** `pandas` `numpy` `seaborn` `matplotlib` `scipy`

## ❤️ Project 4 — Heart Disease Prediction

**File:** `Heart_disease_Prediction.py`

Binary classification pipeline to predict heart disease presence based on clinical features, with domain-specific preprocessing and PCA-based dimensionality reduction.

### 🔍 Key Steps

| Step | Details |
|------|---------|
| Domain Preprocessing | Cholesterol and RestingBP zero values replaced with column means (medically invalid zeros) |
| EDA Insights | Age group heart attack rates, sex-based risk, chest pain type analysis, exercise angina impact |
| Encoding | One-Hot Encoding for all categorical features |
| Scaling | `StandardScaler` on numerical columns (`Age`, `RestingBP`, `Cholesterol`, `MaxHR`, `Oldpeak`) |
| Dimensionality Reduction | PCA with `n_components=0.95` — retained 95% variance |

### 📊 Domain Insights from EDA
| Feature | Finding |
|---------|---------|
| Age (Elderly) | 74.4% heart disease rate |
| Sex (Male) | 64.9% vs Female 22.2% |
| Exercise Angina (Yes) | 85.7% heart disease rate |
| Fasting Blood Sugar (High) | 80% heart disease rate |
| Asymptomatic Chest Pain | 78.4% heart disease rate |

**Libraries:** `pandas` `numpy` `matplotlib` `seaborn` `scikit-learn` `sheryanalysis`

## 🚗 Project 5 — Car Price Prediction

**File:** `Car_Price_Predication_model.py`

Regression pipeline on Ford car listings dataset to predict selling price. Compares two encoding strategies — One-Hot Encoding vs Label Encoding — and evaluates both approaches.

### 🔍 Key Steps

| Step | Details |
|------|---------|
| EDA | Price distribution, correlation heatmap, price vs mileage scatter, price by year/fuel/transmission boxplots |
| Encoding Strategy A | One-Hot Encoding for `model`, `transmission`, `fuelType` |
| Encoding Strategy B | Label Encoding for the same columns |
| Scaling | `StandardScaler` on numerical columns (`year`, `mileage`, `engineSize`, `tax`, `mpg`) |
| Model | `LinearRegression` trained and evaluated on both encoded versions |
| Evaluation | R² Score and Adjusted R² Score for both strategies |

### 🧠 Model
```
Algorithm     : Linear Regression
Dataset       : Ford cars CSV
Target        : price
Encoding      : One-Hot (v1) + Label Encoding (v2) — compared
Metrics       : R² | Adjusted R²
```

**Libraries:** `pandas` `numpy` `seaborn` `matplotlib` `scikit-learn`

## 🏦 Project 6 — Insurance Charges Prediction

**File:** `Insurance_Charges_Predictions.py`

The most statistically rigorous project — predicts medical insurance charges with advanced feature selection using **Pearson Correlation** and **Chi-Square tests** to validate which features truly matter.

### 🔍 Key Steps

| Step | Details |
|------|---------|
| EDA | Distributions for `age`, `bmi`, `children`, `charges`; outlier detection with boxplots |
| Encoding | Label Encoding for `sex` and `smoker`; One-Hot Encoding for `region` |
| Feature Engineering | `bmi_category` column created using `pd.cut` (Underweight / Normal / Overweight / Obese) |
| Scaling | `StandardScaler` on numerical columns |
| Pearson Correlation | Computed correlation of all features with `charges` target |
| Chi-Square Testing | Statistical significance test for all categorical features vs binned `charges` |
| Model | `LinearRegression` with MSE, R², and Adjusted R² |

### 📐 Statistical Feature Selection
```
Pearson Correlation  → Measures linear relationship of numerical features with charges
Chi-Square Test      → Tests independence of categorical features vs charges bins
Decision             → "Reject NULL (keep Feature)" if p-value < 0.05
```

**Libraries:** `pandas` `numpy` `seaborn` `matplotlib` `scikit-learn` `scipy`
